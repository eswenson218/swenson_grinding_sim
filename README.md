# Paint Drying Games

The games are:
1.  **Paint Drying Sim:** A defense game.
2.  **Paint Drying Clicker:** An artistic clicker game.
3.  **Free Paint:** A simple free drawing application.

# Getting Started

To run this game, you need to have **Python 3.x** installed. You will also need to install:
**Pygame**
**Pillow (PIL)**

if you need help, this is the video I used:

Make sure that **all of the python files are in the same folder** and the **sprites and music/sounds are in a folder called images and sounds, respectively, and these folders are in the same one as the python files**
This includes:
 - main.py
 - paint_drying_sim.py
 - paint_drying_clicker.py
 - free_paint.py
 - settings.py
 - sprites.py
 - utils.py
 - the sprites in a folder called 'images'
 - the music and sounds in a folder called 'sounds'
    **The folder names must be uncapitalized**

# Running the Game

Run the game from **main.py** to access all features.

If you only want to play one of the games, you can run it from its file, but running main.py is recommended for a better experience.

# Features

1. **Paint Drying Sim** (PDS)
Goal: Protect the painting from animals for a set duration to win.

Controls: Click or tap the mobs to eliminate them. (Touchscreen is recommended).

Features: Offers a difficulty selection screen before starting.

2. **Paint Drying Clicker** (PDC)
Goal: Click the painting to gain "dryness"

Features: Spend dryness on upgrades to increase Dryness Per Click (DPC) and Dryness Per Second (DPS).
    Unlock Permanent Upgrades (Upgrade Upgrades) by ascending. (Be careful! Ascending wipes most of your progress.)

Useful to Know: The abreviations used are DPC and DPS
    DPC stands for Dryness Per Click
    DPS stands for Dryness per Second

3. **Free Paint**
Goal: Make some cool art!

Controls:

Draw: Click and drag. Press D to enter draw mode.

Erase: Press E to enter erase mode.

Change Color: Use Left Control + Q through L keys.

Change Size: Use number keys (1-0) for standard sizes, and Left Alt + number keys for finer ones.

4. **Settings**
The Settings menu allows you to adjust some variables:

Volume: Adjust the background music and sound effects volume (0 to 100).

Mob Speed: Adjust the speed of mobs in the Paint Drying Sim (1 to 10).

5. **Help**
Provides help on how to play the games from inside the game.
I would recommend using this if you are unsure on how the game works or what to do.
